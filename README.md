[QuickChart](https://quickchart.io/) is a service that generates images of charts from a URL.  Because these charts are simple images, they are very easy to embed in non-dynamic environments such as email, SMS, chat rooms, and so on.

## See it in action

The chart image generation service is available online at [QuickChart.io](https://quickchart.io/).  There is an interactive editor that allows you to adjust inputs and build images.

Here's an example chart that is defined completely by its URL:

<img src="https://quickchart.io/chart?bkg=white&c=%7Btype%3A%27bar%27%2Cdata%3A%7Blabels%3A%5B%27January%27%2C%27February%27%2C%27March%27%2C%27April%27%2C%27May%27%5D%2Cdatasets%3A%5B%7Blabel%3A%27Dogs%27%2Cdata%3A%5B50%2C60%2C70%2C180%2C190%5D%7D%2C%7Blabel%3A%27Cats%27%2Cdata%3A%5B100%2C200%2C300%2C400%2C500%5D%7D%5D%7D%7D" width="500" />

The above image can be included anywhere you like.  Here is its URL:

[https://quickchart.io/chart?width=500&height=300&c={type:'bar',data:{labels:['January','February','March','April','May'],datasets:[{label:'Dogs',data:[50,60,70,180,190]},{label:'Cats',data:[100,200,300,400,500]}]}}](https://quickchart.io/chart?width=500&height=300&c={type:'bar',data:{labels:['January','February','March','April','May'],datasets:[{label:'Dogs',data:[50,60,70,180,190]},{label:'Cats',data:[100,200,300,400,500]}]}})

As you can see, the Javascript or JSON object contained in the URL defines the chart:

```js
{
  type: 'bar',
  data: {
    labels: ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May'],
    datasets: [{
      label: 'Dogs',
      data: [ 50, 60, 70, 180, 190 ]
    }, {
      label: 'Cats',
      data: [ 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 ]
    }]
  }
}
```

## Configuring your chart

**See [full QuickChart documentation](https://quickchart.io/documentation) for more information and examples.**

The chart configuration object is based on the popular Chart.js API.  Check out the [Chart.js documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/) for more information on how to customize your chart, or see [QuickChart documentation](https://quickchart.io/documentation#parameters) for API options.

QuickChart includes several Chart.js plugins that allow you to add chart annotations, data labels, and more: `chartjs-plugin-datalabels`, `chartjs-plugin-annotation`, `chartjs-plugin-piechart-outlabels`, `chartjs-chart-radial-gauge`, `chartjs-chart-box-and-violin-plot `, `chartjs-plugin-doughnutlabel`, and `chartjs-plugin-colorschemes`.

## QR Codes

The service also produces QR codes.  For example, https://quickchart.io/qr?text=Hello+world produces:

![https://quickchart.io/qr?text=Hello+world](https://quickchart.io/qr?text=Hello+world)

The `/qr` endpoint has the following query parameters:
  - `text` - QR code data (required)
  - `format` - png or svg (png default)
  - `size` - size in pixels of one side of the square image (defaults to 150)
  - `margin` - size of the QR image margin in modules (defaults to 4)
  - `ecLevel` - Error correction level (defaults to M)
  - `dark` - Hex color code for dark portion of QR code (defaults to `000000`)
  - `light` - Hex color code for light portion of QR code (defauls to `ffffff`)

## Dependencies and Installation

Chart generation requires several system dependencies: Cairo, Pango, libjpeg, and libgif.  Run `./scripts/setup.sh` for a fresh install on Linux machines (note that this also installs yarn, node, and monit).

To install system dependencies on Mac OSX, you probably just need to `brew install cairo pango libffi`.  You may have to `export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib/pkgconfig"` before installing node packages.

Once you have system dependencies installed, run `yarn install` or `npm install` to install the node dependencies.

## Running the server

`node index.js` will start the server on port 3400.  Set your `PORT` environmental variable to change this port.

## Docker

A docker image is available on dockerhub at [ianw/quickchart](https://hub.docker.com/r/ianw/quickchart).

#### Building

`Dockerfile` sets up a server that provides chart and qr code web endpoints.  It is not parameterized and provides exactly the same web service as https://quickchart.io/.

The Docker image for this project is built with the following command:
```
docker build -t ianw/quickchart .
```

#### Running

The server runs on port 3400 within the container.  This command will expose the server on port 8080 on your host (hostport:containerport):

```
docker run -p 8080:3400 ianw/quickchart
```

The production service on QuickChart.io runs behind an NGINX reverse proxy via the config available in `nginx/`.  You should modify this for your own purposes or use a docker image such as [nginx-proxy](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy).  Of course, you can always serve traffic directly from Node, but it is generally best practice to put something in front of it.

## Deploy

By following the **Docker** instructions above, you can deploy the service to any platform that supports running containers.

Clicking the following will execute the Docker build on a remote machine and deploy the service to [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.run) an automatically scaled and pay-per-request environment:

[![Run on Google Cloud](https://storage.googleapis.com/cloudrun/button.svg)](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/editor?shellonly=true&cloudshell_image=gcr.io/cloudrun/button&cloudshell_git_repo=https://github.com/typpo/quickchart)

## Health and Monitoring

QuickChart has two API endpoints to determine the health of the service.

`/healthcheck` is a basic endpoint that returns a 200 status code and a JSON object that looks like this: `{"success":true,"version":"1.1.0"}`.

A second endpoint, `/healthcheck/chart` returns a 302 status code and redirects to a chart with random attributes.  Although it is a more expensive endpoint, it can be useful for cache busting or testing chart rendering.

The hosted QuickChart service uses [monit](https://mmonit.com/monit/) to make sure the service is online and restart it if not.  An example monit config is in `test/monit`.

## Chart.js v3

Chart.js v3 is supported via the `version` parameter ([documentation](https://quickchart.io/documentation/) to read more about parameters).  Custom chart plugins such as annotations and outlabels are disabled for >= 3.0.0 due to lack of support.

Each QuickChart instance should use 1 specific version of the Chart.js library.  Mixing and matching versions (e.g., rendering a v2 chart followed by a v3 chart) is not well supported.
